## Summary
Work on receding-horizon trajectory planning. Provides a provably safe and persistently feasible (a new solution is always ready in time for execution) planner. Compares to RRT and nonlinear MPC

Note: contains a VERY thorough review of safe motion plannning

Sample-based (RRT), NMPC, and reachability
