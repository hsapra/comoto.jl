## Summary
Introduces 10 challenges to integrating a robotic autonomous agent into a human team. Relevant to our approach are:

"Intelligent agents must be able to adequately model the other participants’ intentions and actions vis-à-vis the joint activity’s state and evolution"

"Human-agent team members must be mutually predictable."

"Agents must be able to make pertinent aspects of their status and intentions obvious to their teammates"
